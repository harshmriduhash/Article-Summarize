### In 2023, we now have the power to build robust AI software startups! I Made an Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model.

### Alongside building this application, here are few features:-

### setup a ReactJS project using Vite
created a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
made advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
save history using the local storage
handle form events and catch errors
implement copy to clipboard
clean code

### This minimalistic cozy color app is an open-source article summarizer that transforms lengthy articles into clear and concise summaries, powered by RapidAPI (limited requests per day).
